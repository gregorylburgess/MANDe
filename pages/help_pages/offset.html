<h2>Translates a cartesian point to the center of the gridcell it represents.  This is necessary
for drawing Line of Sight since we assume sensors are in the center of cells.
ex: the cartesian point (3,2) would be converted to (2.5, 1.5), which puts it in the
cell located at the third column, second row (aka the cell at (3,2) on a 1-based grid
system).</h2>
