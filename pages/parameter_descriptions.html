	<h2>Fish Model Variables</h2>
	
		<h3>Fish Model Algorithm</h3> 
		The choice here should reflect the prior knowledge about the long-term 
		distribution of fish within the study region.Options are Random Walk 
		or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU). 
		</br> 
		
		<b>Random Walk (RW):</b> </br> Purely diffusive movements with no locational or directional
		preference. This results in a uniform distribution of fish over the
		study region. Useful when no knowledge about fish behaviour is
		available or can be assumed.</br> 
		
		<b>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU):</b> Movements
		within a limited region mimicking fish with a home range. This results
		in a normal distribution with two parameters: the home range center
		(mean), and the home range extents and shape (covariance). This is
		useful if the study species is known to prefer a specific geographic
		region. The covariance controls the strength of attraction toward this
		specific region. 
		</br>
		<h3>Home range center (OU only)</h3> 
		x and y coordinate of the home range center given as proportion of axes. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Home range size (OU only)</h3> 
		Standard deviation in meters of home
		range extents. A rule of thumb says that for each direction in
		isolation approximately 95% of the time is spent within plus minus two
		standard deviations. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Home range directional correlation (OU only)</h3> 
		Correlation spatial distribution between directions. This is useful is the home
		range shape is angled relative to the x,y coordinate system. The
		correlation must be in the range [-1; 1]. 
		</br> 
		</br>
		
	<h2>Optional Fish Model Variables</h2>
		<h3>Restrict Vertical Habitat Range</h3> 
		Restricts fish to habitat
		regions within a given depth range. This is useful if the fish is known
		to live in a certain vertical habitat say [-10; -50] meters. If
		unspecified the species is assumed to be able to utilize the whole
		water column. Enabling this reveals the two following parameters: "Min
		Depth" & "Max Depth". 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Min Depth</h3> 
		Specifies the shallowest depth in meters a fish will
		visit. Valid values are non-positive real numbers.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Max Depth</h3> 
		Specifies the deepest depth in meters a fish will
		visit. Valid values are non-positive real numbers. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Use Depth Preference</h3> 
		Within the vertical habitat fish may also
		have a preference to linger at a certain height relative to the bottom.
		This is specified with a normal distribution with a mean preferred
		height relative to the bottom and a standard deviation (SD). Enabling
		the Depth Preference reveals the two following parameters: "Preferred
		Depth" & "SD of Preferred Depth". 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Preferred Depth</h3> 
		Depth preference of fish relative to bottom
		(in meters off the bottom). Valid values are non-negative real numbers.
		</br>
		
		<h3>SD of Preferred Depth</h3> 
		Strength of depth preference as a
		standard deviation, 95% of the time is spent within plus minus 2*SD.
		Units are in meters. Valid values are negative real numbers. 
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		
	<h2>Sensor Variables</h2>
		<h3>Number of Sensors to Use</h3> 
		Specifies how many sensors the system should try to place. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>'Goodness' Algorithm</h3> Specify how you want the system to
		determine the "goodness" of a cell. Options are 1, 2, or 3.
		</br> 
		A value of '1' indicates that a "good" cell has a high number of animals within
		detection range (ignoring line of sight). This is useful for sensors
		not restricted to line-of-sight detection. 
		</br>
		A value of '2' indicates that a "good" cell has the best visibility (taking into account
		bathymetry and shadowing, but completely ignoring fish density). This
		is useful for networks restricted to line-of-sight detection and having
		no prior knowledge of animal habitat. 
		</br>
		A value of '3' indicates that a
		"good" cell has a high number of visible fish (incorporating both
		bathymetry and animal density). This is useful for networks restricted
		to line-of-sight detection, and having some idea of animal habitat. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Sensor Elevation</h3>
		Specifies how far off the bottom a sensor should be placed.  Units are in meters. 
		Valid values are non-negative real numbers.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Sensor Shape function</h3>
		Determines which functional shape to represent horizontal acoustic attenuation in the
		water. The detection function specifies how the chance of signal
		detection declines as a function of distance to sensor. Ranging
		experiments should preferably be carried out locally at the study site
		to approximate this function. Options are : shape.T, shape.gauss, and
		shape.sigmoidal.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Max Detection Value</h3>
		The probability of detecting a fish
		located right next to the sensor. Specifies a maximum value for the
		shape function. Values should be a decimal between 0.05 and 1.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Detection Range</h3>
		The distance in meters from the sensor where the chance of detecting a signal is 0.05.
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		
	<h2>Bathymetry Variables</h2>
		<h3>Input File</h3> 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Input File Type</h3> 
		Specifies the file type of the Bathy file you provided. Options are ArcGIS, NetCDF, and ASC. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Data Series Name</h3>
		For ArcGIS/NetCDF, this specifies the name of the data series to use.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Grid cell size</h3> 
		Specifies the size of the grid cell in meters.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Beginning X Index</h3> 
		Specifies the starting X cell-index of the area of interest for the file chosen. 
		Valid values are non-negative integers.
		</br>
		
		<h3>X Axis Length</h3>
		Specifies how far the area of interest extends
		along the X axis. Units are in number of bathymetric grid cells. Valid
		values are non-negative integers. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Beginning Y Index</h3>
		Specifies the starting Y cell-index of the
		area of interest for the file chosen. Valid values are non-negative
		integers.
		</br>
		
		<h3>Y Axis Length</h3>
		Specifies how far the area of interest extends
		along the Y axis. Units are in number of bathymetric grid cells. Valid
		values are non-negative integers.
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		
	<h2>Suppression Variables</h2>
		In order to prevent the program from
		placing sensors too near or on top of each other, a suppression
		function is used to reduce the goodness of cells around already placed
		sensors. Another way to think of this mechanism is that the program
		tries to enforce a minimum bound on the sparsity of the sensor network
		with the result that sensors are more spread out.
		</br>
				
		<h3>Suppression Factor</h3> 
		Specifies the range of suppression in
		multiples of the detection range. For example, a suppression factor of
		2 enforces a suppression range of two times the detection range. Cells
		within the suppression range of a sensor will be subject to the
		specified suppression function. To deter sensor overlap, a good value
		to use is equal to or higher than the sensor Detection Range specified
		above. Valid values are non-negative real numbers. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Suppression Function</h3>
		Specify suppression function to use.
		Options are <b>suppression.static</b>, <b>suppression.scale</b>, <b>detection.function</b>,
		<b>detection.function.shadow</b>, or <b>detection.function.exact</b>.
		</br>
		<b>suppression.static:</b></br> Replaces all cells within range of a sensor with
		the value specified in Min suppression value. 
		</br>
		<b>suppression.scale:</b> </br>
		Multiplies the values of cells within range of a sensor by a scaling
		factor according to the cell's distance from the sensor. Nearby cells
		receive a higher scaling factor, and lower cells receive a lower
		scaling factor. The scaling factor is linearly related to the distance
		between the sensor and cell. Minimum and Maximum values for scaling
		factors can be specified below. 
		</br>
		<b>detection.function:</b> </br>Uses the inverse
		of the detection function to down scale goodness of grid cells near the
		sensor, but does not take objects that block signal into account. Grid
		cells' goodness will increase as a function of distance to the sensor.
		</br>
		<b>detection.function.shadow:</b> </br>Uses the inverse of the detection
		function to down scale goodness of grid cells near the sensor, and does
		take objects that block signal into account. This means that sensors on
		opposite sides of a blocking wall will not affect each other's
		goodness. Unblocked grid cells' goodness will increase as a function of
		distance to the sensor. 
		</br>
		<b>detection.function.exact:</b> </br>The above suppression
		functions do not recalculate the goodness grid after placing a new
		sensor and therefore only provide an approximately optimal solution.
		This suppression function does recalculate the goodness iteratively,
		and is therefore slower by a factor equal to the number of sensors. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Max Suppression Value (model 1+2 only)</h3>
		Specifies the maximum
		scaling factor to apply. Cells directly adjacent to a sensor will
		receive this as a scaling factor. 
		</br>
		
		<h3>Min suppression Value (model 2 only)</h3>
		Specifies the minimum
		scaling factor to apply. Cells at the edge of the suppression Range
		will receive this as a scaling factor.
