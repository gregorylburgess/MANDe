<center><h2>The Acoustic Web App</h2></center>
<p>This Acoustic Web App is designed for researchers looking to use stationary, Line-of-Sight-based, sensor networks to track aquatic animals.  
Given high-resolution bathymetry, and a few other variables, the program will simulate fish movements, and suggest near-optimal placements
for sensors within the specified area of interest. These results are based on shadowing due to bathymetry (hence the need for high-resolution
bathymetry) as well as advanced behavioral simulation.  The source code for this application is easily extensible, well documented, and 
freely available. </br>
